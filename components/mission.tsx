            Bitcoin has the potential not only to revolutionize online payments, but also to give
            control over their financial transactions and assets back to individuals, and to serve as an
            asset with exceptionally strong property guarantees. Furthermore, its technology has the
            potential to serve as a platform for countless other services that can benefit from
            decentralized consensus and cryptographically secure tracking of property. As an
            Association, we want to pave the way for Bitcoin to flourish and unfold its full potential.
